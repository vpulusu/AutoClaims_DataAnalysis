# AutoClaims_DataAnalysis

Worked with a dataset of auto claims filed by customers of an automobile insurance company located in the southwest and western regions of the United States.
Insurance companies depend on accurate pricing estimates to maintain profitability. Auto policies must be priced so that the insurance company makes a profit in the long run, given the costs of their customers' payouts for accident repairs, total loss car replacements, medical fees, and legal fees.
The executives at this insurance company have noticed declining profitability over the last several years and have hired you as a data science consultant to evaluate their claims data and make recommendations on pricing, customer behavior, and car insurance policy adjustments.
